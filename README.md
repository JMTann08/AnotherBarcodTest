This is a barcode scanner I am making partly for fun, partly to imporve my skill, and partly to make something easier at work. 
This project is based off what youtube user Try Catch Finally demonstrated in his video located at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czmEC5akcos. 
If it were not for this video I would not have this project. I do intend to make modifications and learn from this project.
